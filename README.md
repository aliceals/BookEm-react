# BookEm

This was my personal project for Dev Academy

It is a booking app for contractors with a sign in
for clients and for contractors

I initially made this app with handlebars until we
learnt React and then I moved the project over to React

A goal of mine during this project was to learn how to
do authorisation and logins. I completed this by
Following an online tutorial of sessions and gaining
an understanding of how it works.
